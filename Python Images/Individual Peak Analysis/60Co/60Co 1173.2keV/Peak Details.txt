the program guessed the origional peak had a 
Standard deviation of : 35.52651753754237
Peak Mean of : 1361.4345517833137
Scalar Multiplier of : 26191.893298511728

the algorithm then refined this estimate to find the accurate values that
Standard deviation is :29.28673192452023
Peak Mean is at : 1361.9614248556036
Peak Area is : 19777.46291838925
Background Slope is : -0.06034393872561596
Background intercept is : 119.03815672676858
