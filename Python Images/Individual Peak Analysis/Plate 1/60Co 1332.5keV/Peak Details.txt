the program guessed the origional peak had a 
Standard deviation of : 37.0013884347
Peak Mean of : 1364.2904422
Scalar Multiplier of : 22420.1886862

the algorithm then refined this estimate to find the accurate values that
Standard deviation is :29.5316415721
Peak Mean is at : 1364.69911621
Peak Area is : 16019.0495915
Background Slope is : -0.0503337934383
Background intercept is : 105.101157318
