the program guessed the origional peak had a 
Standard deviation of : 31.33086783767845
Peak Mean of : 1200.9741779797814
Scalar Multiplier of : 26998.965198238184

the algorithm then refined this estimate to find the accurate values that
Standard deviation is :26.845087913976645
Peak Mean is at : 1203.2812562068061
Scalar Multiplier is : 21305.334638953675
Background Slope is : -0.3163614113182548
Background intercept is : 417.8314502196369
Peak Area is : 21217.369600560443
